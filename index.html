                        And the chicken was great. It's a shame I won't visit Glen Waverley again otherwise I'll definitely come back."

                        "Nice place to grab a quick hot meal. The staff is very friendly, the service is quick and the taste is pretty good. 
                        The burgers are our favourite. They are huge and are juicy. The focaccia roles are equally delicious. 
                        The chips are always crispy and hot. The chicken is juicy, nicely flavoured and they give an additional piece on the house once in a while. 
                        They are very generous with the fries as well. The freshly cooked noodles and rice is also pretty good. 
                        The salads are fulfilling and pretty heavy. They have a decent selection on the drinks as well. 
                        Also, there is parking available right in front of the store if you are lucky."
